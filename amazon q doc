Amazon Q Code Migration: From Java 7 to Java 17 (with Automated Transformation For Report Tracking Application)
Purpose:

This document provides a comprehensive guide on leveraging Amazon Q's "Developer Agent capability for Code Transformation" to seamlessly upgrade Spring Boot Java applications from older versions, specifically demonstrated with a migration from Java 7 to Java 17. It covers prerequisites, detailed setup instructions, the migration process using Amazon Q's AI chat, and insights into the expected outcomes and timeline.

Introduction to Amazon Q's Developer Agent for Code Transformation

Amazon Q introduces powerful "agents" designed to autonomously handle complex, multi-step tasks. Among these is the "Developer Agent for Code Transformation," a specialized agent that fully automates the process of upgrading and refactoring Java applications. This agent can transform code from any lower Java version to any upper Java version, significantly reducing manual effort and potential errors in migration projects

2)	Prerequisites: 
Before embarking on the migration process, ensure the following software and access requirements are met:
Java Development Kit (JDK) 7: Required for the original Java 7 application to be built and run.
Java Development Kit (JDK) 17: The target Java version for the migration.
Visual Studio Code (VS Code): The integrated development environment (IDE) where the Amazon Q extension will be installed and used.
GitHub Access: Necessary for authentication within the Amazon Q extension and potentially for managing code changes.
Apache Maven 3.8.9: The version of Maven compatible with and used by the original Java 7 project.
Apache Maven 3.9.10: The target version of Maven, typically required for building Java 17 applications.

   3) Project Setup and Environment Configuration:
Proper setup of your development environment is crucial for a smooth migration

JDK Installation and Configuration:
Install both JDK 7 and JDK 17 on your system.
Configure the environment variables (e.g., `JAVA_HOME`, `PATH`) to correctly point to both JDK installations, ensuring that the appropriate JDK can be invoked when needed.
Maven Configuration:
Download Apache Maven 3.8.9.
Configure this Maven version to be used with your Java 7 project. This typically involves setting `M2_HOME` and updating `PATH` or configuring it within your IDE for the specific project.
Visual Studio Code Installation:
Download and install VS Code from its official website: https://code.visualstudio.com/
Amazon Q Extension Installation:
Open Visual Studio Code.
Navigate to the Extensions view by clicking the Extensions icon (or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`).
In the search bar, type "Amazon Q".
Locate the "Amazon Q" extension and click the "Install" button.

Amazon Q with AWS Builder sign-in:
Navigate to the https://profile.aws.amazon.com/ and sign-in to aws builder account. Create a new account using email id if the account is not created.



After the Amazon Q extension is installed, Click on the amazon q icon on the left side of VS Code. AMAZON Q LOGIN  interface will appear to choose sign-in options..

Select the ‚ÄúPersonal account‚Äù option and click on Continue. It will redirect and open the authentication url in the browser to provide access to amazon q.

Click on the ‚Äúallow access‚Äù  to grant the necessary permissions to Amazon Q.

4) Automated Migration to Java 17 Using Amazon Q
Once your environment is set up, you can proceed with the automated migration.

Initial Application Build and Test (Java 7):

Before initiating the migration process, it is mandatory to build and run your existing Java 7 application.
Thoroughly test all end-points and execute all existing JUnit test cases to ensure the application is fully functional and stable in its original state. This is essential for verifying the success of the migration.


Initiating Migration via Amazon Q AI Chat:

Open the Amazon Q AI chat interface within VS Code.
Enter the following prompt:
‚ÄúExecute a Java migration project with the following strict requirements:
Compilation Requirements:
Target Platform: JDK 17 ONLY
Remove all JDK 7 specific code and dependencies
Ensure code compiles and runs exclusively on JDK 17
Remove/replace any multi-release JAR dependencies
Migration Scope:
Core Language Updates:

This enhanced prompt emphasizes:
Strict JDK 17 compatibility requirements
Specific modernization targets
Clear testing framework updates
Defined quality gates
Required deliverables 
Implement Javadoc in all classes:
Key Components of Method Javadoc
A brief description of the method's purpose
@param tags for each parameter
@return tag (if the method returns a value)
@throws or @exception tags for any exceptions
@see tags for related methods or classes (optional)


Amazon Q will then begin analyzing your project and applying the necessary transformations.

But for projects having more than 30 files, amazon Q was not able to transform each file there were only a few files that got modified.
So, to amazonQ to work perfectly we need to attach few packages first like below in the context :

By doing this amazon Q will be able to transform all the possible files .
Once the processing completed for these packages then we can provide other packages with below prompts :

Iteratively we can pass this prompt by selecting the different packages from the project till end.

Addressing Post-Migration Issues (Example):

During or after the initial migration, Amazon Q might highlight or you might encounter compilation errors or issues.
Example Scenario: After trying to run an application, multiple exceptions in the different classes which got resolved while debugging manually and by amazon Q itself.Below are the summary of the most of the errors which got resolved by amazonQ : 
Summary Of Fixes :


AWS Credentials Configuration :
Fixed the AWS credentials in application.properties by removing the placeholder syntax ${...}
Updated AWSUtil.java to use StaticCredentialsProvider with AwsBasicCredentials instead of DefaultCredentialsProvider
Added proper credential injection using @Value annotations
Maven Configuration :
Updated the main class in pom.xml from the incorrect com.mbdt.app.rnb.dsp.App to com.mb.app.r.dsp.WeatherReportConsole


3. Application Execution Results
‚úÖ SUCCESS: The application now runs successfully and:
Fetches weather data for Delhi
Generates a CSV file with weather information
Uploads the CSV file to S3 bucket testcsv-report
Completes without errors


Summary of Test Fixes
‚úÖ Successfully Fixed:
AWS S3 Upload Issue - Fixed AWS credentials configuration and S3 client setup
Application Properties - Created proper application-test.properties with dummy test values
Maven Configuration - Updated main class in pom.xml

Final Verification:

After Amazon Q indicates completion and any subsequent fixes, perform the following:
Compile the entire project.
Build the application.
Run the transformed application.
Thoroughly test all end-points to ensure functionality.
Execute all JUnit test cases to confirm they pass and that the refactoring has not introduced regressions.
5. Migration Outcomes and Observations
Time Taken: For the demonstrated project migration, the entire process, including initial setup and problem resolution, took approximately 145 minutes.
Code Changes: Amazon Q automatically generates the necessary code changes. A specific commit detailing these changes for a sample project is available at: 
https://github.com/telusDemoProject/ReportTrackerApp/tree/java7_to_17_migration_using_AmazonQ
Refactoring: The agent effectively refactors the code to leverage Java 17 features (e.g., Lambdas, Streams, new Date/Time API, etc.), enhancing code readability and efficiency.Below are the snapshot of the changes in the respective files.


File 1:


File 2: Proper documentation added for each classes


File 3: Code got crisped and concise with the help of new features


JUnit Test Classes: Existing JUnit test classes are updated to be compatible with Java 17 and the refactored code

File 1:





File 2:Test cases got improved and upgraded with Junit 5



Code Coverage: Amazon Q also assists in ensuring code coverage is maintained or improved post-migration




API Testing: All existing APIs are expected to function correctly after the migration.
